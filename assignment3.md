*Cleaning Steps* 
1. Put all headers into the same format and fixed spelling
2. Deleted columns that didn’t have any seasonal information
3. Put all operational months into the same format
4. Attempted to split seasonal start and end dates into two different columns (unsuccessful)
5. Attempted to split column P into three different columns according to Farmer Market’s day of the week, and operation timeframes. (Unsuccessful) 
6. Cells with  “-“ were replaced with “unknown” for the “organic” section 
7. The last updated time and date were split into two different columns
