<p>Are DCPS’ food access programs actually working?</p>
<p>A 2017-2018 study conducted by DC Hunger Solutions found that DCPS failed to meet its  goal of providing food to 70% of area children.</p>
<p>With several hunger solution programs that are in place, I want to explore why this goal went unmet, and will use datasets from DCPS to examine which areas in the city had the largest need. Questions for exploration include: 

* Why weren’t these goals met? 
* How did the schools determine which students were fed? 
* What happened to the students who went without? 
* What measures were put into place to reach the 70% goal for the following school year?</p>

<p> How wasteful are DCPS's cafeterias?<p>
<p> Cafeteria food waste is a major problem across America, with nearly 36.7 pounds of food going to waste per student each year, according to The Grist. Data from the USDA highlighted in the article also showed that the National School Lunch program wastes nearly $5 million a day in edible food. I’d like to localize this story to DC and examine how much food from school lunches are being thrown away, and where the food goes afterward. Another portion of this story would test the efficacy of DCPS’ classroom composting and recycling initiatives by comparing the levels of waste from “before and after” the programs were started. Two questions I’d like to ask: Does unfamiliarity with certain foods lead to students throwing it away? How much food waste is generated from DCPS’ school gardens?

### Waste Not, Want Not by The Grist 
[Schools was $5 million a day in uneaten food](https://grist.org/article/schools-waste-5-million-a-day-in-uneaten-food-heres-how-oakland-is-reinventing-the-cafeteria/)  
This critique is for story idea #2

**Objective & Clarity rating: 5** I was able to quickly identify this feature article's mission by its subhead, "Schools waste $5 million a day in uneaten food. Here's how Oakland is reinventing the cafeteria."

**Navigating Data rating: 2** This article uses several statistics from the USDA and California state agencies that could have been easily showcased through some sort of visual/interactive graphic. Reading two lengthy statistics back-to-back from various agencies wasn't the most efficient way to convey the information, especially since the Oakland school was being compared to national averages. 

**Data Accuracy Rating: 5** Yes, I believe the data used in this article was extremely accurate. Since the reporter used information from the USDA, Oakland's Environmental Health Department, and hyperlinks to other sources/data from government agencies, I believe all areas of concern were explained efficiently.  I also enjoyed how the reporter chose to do a feature article about the country's only public school nutrition sustainability manager to highlight the issue of cafeteria food waste. The anecdotes set the stage for the data/sources used in the article to be understood in a familiar and digestible way.

**Creativity: 3** Outside of the story having a narrative lede that focused on a student tossing unwanted fruit into a "share basket," I don't believe the article was significantly creative. 


### [The New Face of Hunger by The National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/foodfeatures/hunger/) 
This critique is for story idea one 

**Objective & Clarity rating: 5** Upon loading the article, you're immediately met with a graphic that says "The New Face of Hunger" and a subhead/graphic that asks "Why are people malnourished in the richest country on Earth?" For me, this changing graphic immediately gets to the point of the article, and the photo series near the top of the page further drives this point with photo galleries of various hungry families in America. The article's main point: examining why 1 in 6 families doesn't have enough to eat, is highlighted in the introductory portion of the page. 

**Navitgating Data rating: 5** After a brief overview comparing hungry households from 2010 to those in the 1980's, the article provides a map showing how many households across the country were dependant on SNAP benefits. The most interesting part about the map is that smaller maps are created to showcase the regions that have the highest percentages of SNAP recipients (captions explain systemic issues those communities that increase benefit usage). As the article begins to transition to food deserts, a heat map is presented on a slightly contrasting background that visually signals a change in discussion. Photos and detailed captions alternating in between graphics offer a human element to a story that heavily relies on written data and charts.

**Data Accuracy rating: 5** I believe all sources and data used for this story are extremely credible. My only suggestion would be to cite where the figures originated from within the captions of the graphics themselves, instead of having to fish for the information within a long article.

**Type & Color rating: 5** I believe the reporter/graphic creator followed all typography and color standards accordily. Graphics of the same subtopic followed the same orange color scheme for heat maps, and were very easy to understand. Graphs at the bottom of article that focused on crops were green, and were easy to follow as well. 

**Creativity rating: 5** The most creative part about this article are the photo galleries that showed three very different families (based on career, race/ethnicity, etc.) but all shared the similar problem of food insecurity. It was a different way to understand the data presented in a visual and anecdotal way.
