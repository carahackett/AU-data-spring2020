# Interview a data set

For this assignment, I chose to examine data to compare prices between produce and snack/junk foods. The data I found was taken from the USDA's Economic Research Service, and compared the price, calorie intake, and portion size of 20 fruits and vegetables to 20 snacks (many were salty or sugary options). 

*Questions for data*

1. Do snack prices stay the same over time in comparison to fruits and vegetables? (Not answered by this particular data set). 
2. What is the percentage difference in calories from fruit versus calories from snacks? 
3. For people on limited budgets, are canned fruits and vegetables a better option than buying fresh fruits? (Compare the nutritional info between canned/pre-packaged fruit to fresh fruit, and then compare the prices). Yes, technically. Canned fruits and vegetables still offer a similar calorie intake than fresh produce at a lower price. 
4. The dataset is based on the consumption habits of children aged 6-13. Are parents eating more fruits and vegetables than their children? (Not answered by this particular dataset)

Steps to clean data: 
1. Copied data from table into a new excel sheet
2. Separated fruits and vegetables from the snacks 
3. Labeled each grocery item by its type (fruit vs vegetable vs snack)
4. Labeled each grocery item by it being fresh/packaged
5. Copied snack data into the table
6. Labeled the snacks by its preparation

### Headline: Cake by the pound: Data shows that unhealthy snacks are (insert percent) cheaper than fresh fruits
    Nutgraf: New data by the USDA finds that American children's nutritional needs are primarily met by salty, sweet, and calorie dense snacks. Experts believe that the significant price differences between fresh produce and prepackaged snacks are to blame.
