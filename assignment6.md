# Interview a data set

For this assignment, I chose to examine data to compare prices between produce and snack/junk foods. The data I found was taken from the USDA's Economic Research Service, and compared the price, calorie intake, and portion size of 20 fruits and vegetables to 20 snacks (many were salty or sugary options). 

*Questions for data*

1. Do snack prices stay the same over time in comparison to fruits and vegetables? 
2. What is the percentage difference in calories from fruit versus calories from snacks? 
3. For people on limited budgets, are canned fruits and vegetables a better option than buying fresh fruits? (Compare the nutritional info between canned/pre-packaged fruit to fresh fruit, and then compare the prices). 
4. The dataset is based on the consumption habits of children aged 6-13. Are parents eating more fruits and vegetables than their children?
