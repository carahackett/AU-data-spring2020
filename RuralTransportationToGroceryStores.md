Rural families without cars are stranded in food deserts 

Imagine waking up on a Saturday evening for your weekly grocery store run. You’ve taken a quick glance in the pantry to survey the remaining food items, written a grocery list, and grabbed your wallet. 

As you head toward the door, you realize something. You don’t have enough gas in your car to make a round trip to the grocery store, can’t take a bus because there isn’t one, and walking to the closest Walmart would take nearly an hour and a half. 

This is the reality for more than 13 percent of Americans living in low-income, rural towns across the country who struggle with transportation to the grocery store. The combination of tight finances and lack of mobility can lead to food inaccessibility for many families. 

Of the 25 most low-income, rural towns in America that were surveyed for this data story, only 10 of them had access to public transportation. In some places like Glasglow, KY, where the median income is $28,362 for a town of 14,338, some of the bus systems operated sporadically. While the Glasglow Transit system is relatively low-cost (they charge $0.50 per ride), it doesn’t operate during inclement weather, on the weekends, or on holidays. 

To add another layer to this, rural bus services oftentimes don’t span multiple counties or operate in the evening once people leave work. Public transportation that doesn’t operate on the weekends poses another problem for its riders since Saturday and Sunday evenings are the most popular times to go grocery shopping, according to the Time Use Institute. 

If a resident misses the bus or if there’s not enough space in the 16-passenger vehicle, they have to wait another hour and a half for the next ride. For comparison, the data showed it’s only a six minute car ride to the town’s nearest Walmart (three miles away). For those without personal transportation, they face a 33-minute bus ride or a 53-minute walk.  

However, situations like this aren’t uncommon. Rural transportation initiatives are often underfunded, and receive less than 10 percent of all federal transportation dollars. As a result, these areas oftentimes don’t have the budget to develop, maintain, or expand a fully-functioning system that meets the needs of car-less households. 

Without regular access to a car, some may find it quite difficult to navigate a trip to the grocery store. But car ownership is just part of the problem. An already cash-strapped household might find it difficult to afford car insurance, maintenance, or gas. 

“Food insecurity is much more closely related to economic conditions like poverty or disability,” said Alisha Coleman-Jensen, a social science analyst with the Economic Resource Service of U.S. Department of Agriculture. “It’s generally higher in rural areas than it is in principle cities or suburban areas.” 

However, Coleman-Jesen said the geographic location of a family can’t always be a determining factor of whether they’ll experience food insecurity. 

“If someone has to travel a distance to the grocery store, it may be a hardship,” she said. “But if they have the means to travel, the geographic location isn’t an issue.” 

Conversely, if they don’t have a car and can’t afford gas, it doesn’t really matter where the grocery store is located if they can’t get there. “It still comes down to economic issues and resources that help people acquire the food they need,” she said. 

For example, [a report found](https://www.bts.gov/archive/publications/highlights_of_the_2001_national_household_travel_survey/section_01)  that  households with an annual income of less than $25,000 are almost nine times as likely to be a zero-vehicle household than households with incomes higher than $25,000. The report also found that households living in rental properties are almost six times as likely to be a zero-vehicle household compared to homeowners, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. 

The median household income for residents in this story? $27, 881. Just $2,100 more than the 2019 federal poverty level for a family of four. 

For this story, the closest proximity from the center point of each respective town to its nearest Walmart was used. It’s one of the few grocery store chains that operates in all 50 states, and has multiple stores in rural and urban areas. Data from this study found that there was at least one Walmart within a five mile radius for 16 of the towns, with an average driving distance of six miles. The other towns had to drive an average of 13.5 miles to the closest Walmart. 

Mary B. Gross of the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance recounted attending a county judge meeting last year in 2019 where attendees voiced their concerns for Lafayette County. The issue? Their only grocery store closed, leaving more than 6,800 without close accessibility to food. The nearest grocery store was 30 to 45 minutes away by car. 

“That was a real problem in their area,” Gross said. “There’s not a lot of public transportation in these rural areas. They have to have a friend to take them.” 

Some states with a high rural population have tried to advocate for better transportation funding and incentives to independent grocers, but no legislation has been passed at the time this article was written. 

 
Article Methodology: 24/7 Wall St. compiled a [list](https://247wallst.com/special-report/2018/05/02/poorest-town-in-every-state-3/print/) of the poorest towns in every state in using median household incomes for places with a population between 1,000-25,000. Median income data was found through the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey.   

From that list, I selected 25 towns that had the lowest median incomes along with low populations. I wanted to know how long it took residents in those communities to travel to Walmart. To find this answer, I [created a dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tkun_XdUau1j6XTOEoD8JoKa4u16GCNdDc60-vC_M94/edit?usp=sharing) using the figures from 24/7 Wall St. and charted the mileage from the center point of each town to the nearest Walmart. Walmart was selected as the primary grocery store for all of the featured towns since there’s at least one in every state and a common endpoint was needed to maintain accuracy. From that data, I used Google Maps to identify how long it would take someone to travel to their closest store by using a car, public transportation, walking, or biking on a Saturday evening at 4 p.m.
