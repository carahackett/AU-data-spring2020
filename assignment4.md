# Find a Story 

I found that Florida A&M University employees donated less to presidental campaigns this election cycle compared to Florida State University. 

Using data from the FEC, I downloaded contribution CSVs for Florida State University employees and Florida A&M University employees, and compared the total donation amounts between the two schools. Since both universities are based in Tallahassee, FL (the state's capital and a very political city), I'd interested to see which campuses are more likely to vote for Republican candidates, and to explore which presidential candidate employees at each school support the most. 
FAMU employees have only donated $2,367 toward the 2020 race as of February, compared to $200,169 from FSU employees. 

I found a commanality of both campuses: if a professor was going to donate, they were more likely to donate to a Democratic candidate/fund than to a Republican campaign. 

How I obtained the data: 
1. Went to the FEC website and browsed individual contributions by employer (one search was for Florida A&M, and the other was for Florida State) 
2. Deleted empty columns and columns with unneccessary information (middle names, for example.  
3. Downloaded the datasets for both universities and looked at the donation sum for FAMU, and then the donation sum for FSU.
