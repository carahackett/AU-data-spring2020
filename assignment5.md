**Final Story Pitch**

For the final project, I’d like to examine the quality of school lunches/food programs across public and private schools in Washington, DC. The quality of the programs would be determined by how many fresh fruits and vegetables are provided to students, the differences in nutritional values (sodium, sugar, etc.), and the availability of food education programs. 

Questions for exploration would include:

1. Are students at their respective schools satisfied with their meals?
2. Do private schools have a bigger nutritional services budget than public? 
3. What are students who rely on food stamps bringing for lunch/snack time?
4. Are schools meeting the needs of their food insecure students?
5. What’s the correlation between better lunches and classroom performance?

To add anecdotal context, I’d like to interview a student, cafeteria manager, and teacher from both public and private schools in the District.  

This story is timely/relevant because DC, Maryland, and Virginia attorneys general joined a national lawsuit to denounce food stamp limitations, and I'm interested to see how the potential of reduced food stamps affects hungry children. 
For visuals, a heat map showing the levels of produce consumption across DC could be used, along with a chart comparing private/public school lunch budgets. Nutritional service data and child hunger data would be sourced from DCPS, selected private schools, and hunger prevention organizations.
